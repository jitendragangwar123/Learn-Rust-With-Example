/*
Memory Issues in Other Languages:
    - In many programming languages, memory management is a manual process that can lead to several issues if not handled correctly. 
Here are some common memory-related problems that developers might face:

1. Buffer Overflow: This occurs when a program writes more data to a fixed-size buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory locations. 
                    Buffer overflows can lead to crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

2. Use-After-Free: This happens when a program continues to use a pointer or reference to memory after that memory has been freed or deallocated. 
                   Accessing freed memory can lead to crashes, unpredictable behavior, or even security exploits.

3. Data Races: A data race occurs when two or more threads access the same memory location concurrently, and at least one of them performs a write operation. 
               Data races can lead to unpredictable behavior and hard-to-debug issues in your program.
